# Fetching And Caching Data

## This repo is my practice for creating custom react hooks for fetching and caching data 

* Implemnet useGetPostsQuery and fetching data from jsonplaceholder api and check if the user request the posts for the first time or note and delivering data to him.
* Implemnet usegetCommentsQuery that fetching users comments pased on userId and casch fetched data and deliver it to the user.
* Implemnt Ignore feature that make the hook only fetch the data in certin way
